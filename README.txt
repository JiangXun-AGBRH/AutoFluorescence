The script for CNN training is named as CNN_training_and_parameters_saving.py
The script for accuracy test is named as Accuracy_test.py
The script for generating the AAFtd with the saved Model is named as Generate_image_with_saved_CNN_paramters.py

To run the scripts, all the imported packages should be installed via PIP or CONDA. CUDA should be available, if the saved plk (trained Model Parameters) is used directly. 

Training images for Stragety II are in folders /bacteria and /roots.
The image used for accuracy test is in folder /BHgfp_3channels
The image for "applying pre-trained Model for other studies" is in folder /GFPMucD4td
The BHgfp_2848td image (Figure 1) used in the study is in the main folder, C1/C2/C3-azo2848proPMP 63.tif.

Two trained and saved model parameters are also in the main folder: BHgfp_3674td_03_cnn_250timesTrained.plk and accuracy_test_2k-trained.plk. The first one is for BHgfp_mucDtd infected roots and the second is for the accuracy test. Same formated file could also be generated by running the offered scripts.
